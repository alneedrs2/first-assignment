                <p>
                    A personal mission statement can help you identify your values and goals, defining what matters most
                    to you professionally. It makes decision-making easier as well, as it clarifies whether the
                    decisions you're making are in alignment with what you want for your life.

                <p>
                    A personal vision statement can help take your life or career in the direction you want to go. Use
                    these personal vision statement examples to help craft one of your own, tailored to your own goals
                    and situation. In contrast to a mission statement, which is about the present moment, a vision
                    statement is about your future.

                    My goals in life are ultimately to achieve success in life. My goals are to also have happiness,
                    prosperity in every area in my life, and the freedom and peace within to be able to carry out my
                    goals.

                Mastery lies on an infinite continuum, and as a result we will never reach the end. We can, however, see
                to it that we are as far along that continuum as our circumstance allows.
